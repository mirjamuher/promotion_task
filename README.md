# promotion_task

This is my solution for Digio's technical interview task. 

## How to run it
Navigate to `runner.py`, update `FILE_PATH` with the path to the data you want to parse, then run the file.

## How to test it
Run `solution.py` and `doctest` will automatically run all tests

## Assumtpions made
1. full URLs and URL paths are treated equally by my code
2. no function in `solution.py` is desigend to be called directly
